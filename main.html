 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		    Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It focuses on understanding how the algorithm's execution time grows with the input, aiming for efficient algorithms that perform tasks swiftly even with larger datasets.

		Space Complexity deals with the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem concerning the input size. In algorithm analysis, we often denote space complexity using the notation O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial as it helps in designing algorithms that utilize memory efficiently.
